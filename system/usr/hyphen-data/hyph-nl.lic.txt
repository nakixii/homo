%         Hyphenation patterns for Dutch in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings.
%         These patterns don't handle cases like 'menuutje' > 'menu-tje',
%         and don't hyphenate words that have different hyphenations according
%         to their meaning.

% ==========================================
% PURPOSE: 8-bit hyphenation patterns for TeX based upon the new Dutch
%          spelling, officially since 1 August 1996. These patterns follow
%          the new hyphenation rules in the ‘Woordenlijst Nederlandse
%          Taal, SDU Uitgevers, Den Haag 1995’ (the so called ‘Groene
%          Boekje’) described in section 5.2 (Het afbreekteken).
%
%          The main differences with our earlier patterns based upon the
%          CELEX dictionary are:
%           (1) provide 8-bit patterns based upon the T1 character encoding
%               (the encoding for DC/EC compatible TeX fonts)
%           (2) don’t hyphenate if this results in a syllable of one letter
%               before or after the hyphen (hence hyphens in a-drenaline,
%               studi-o, mensa-pen and vide-oachtig are invalid)
%           (3) handle words derived from other languages (‘bastaard
%               woorden’) according to the new rules
%
%          Like the CELEX patterns these patterns don’t hyphenate:
%           (4) in a changing syllable (menuutje can not be hyphenated as
%               menu-tje)
%           (5) in words that have different hyphenations according to
%               there meaning (buur-tje/buurt-je)
