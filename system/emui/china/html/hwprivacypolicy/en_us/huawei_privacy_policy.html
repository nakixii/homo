        Personal Data</p>
    <p>A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Personal Data Collected by Huawei</p>
    <p>Before using Huawei products or services, you may need to provide personal data. You do not
        have to provide your personal data to Huawei, but in some cases, Huawei will not be able to
        provide products or services or respond and resolve some issues you encounter if you do not
        provide your personal data.</p>
    <p>Huawei will collect and use your personal data for the purposes stated in this Statement.
        Here are some examples of personal data we may collect:</p>
    <p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Personal data that you provide to Huawei</p>
    <p>You need to register a Huawei ID to enjoy certain functions or services. When you register a
        Huawei ID or log in with a Huawei ID to shop online, download software, or purchase
        services, we will ask you to provide relevant personal data, such as your name, email
        address, mobile number, order information, shipping address, and payment method.</p>
    <p>Some Huawei products allow you to communicate and share information with others. When you use
        a Huawei product to share things with your family and friends, you may need to create a
        Huawei ID that includes certain information which will be made public, including a nickname
        and avatar. Huawei may collect information related to those people, such as their names,
        email addresses, and phone numbers. Huawei will take appropriate and necessary measures to
        ensure the security of the information you provide.</p>
    <p>Huawei may ask you to provide a proof of identity issued by the government or relevant card
        information that can identify you in order to meet requirements in certain jurisdictions,
        abide by anti-game addiction measures, or satisfy the requirements of Internet payment
        platforms.</p>
    <p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Information that Huawei collects when you use services
    </p>
    <p>Huawei will collect data about your device and how you and your device exchange information
        with Huawei products and services. This type of information includes:</p>
    <p>(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Device and application information, such as the
        device name, device identification code (IMEI, ESN, MEID, and SN), device activation time,
        hardware model, OS version, application version, software identification code, and device
        and application settings (such as region, language, time zone, and font size).</p>
    <p>(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mobile network information, such as the public land
        mobile network (PLMN) provider ID, geographical location such as the broadcasting tower in
        the area where the device is located, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address.</p>
    <p>(3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Log information. When you use Huawei services or view
        Huawei-provided content, Huawei will automatically collect and log some information, such as
        the time of access, access count, IP address, and information about incidents (such as
        errors, crashes, restarts, and upgrades).</p>
    <p>(4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Location information. Huawei will collect, use, and
        process the approximate or precise location of your device when you access some
        location-based services (for example, when you search, use navigation software, or view the
        weather at a specific location). Location information can be obtained through GPS, WLAN, and
        service provider network ID. We will ask you to choose the applications for which you want
        to enable location services. In the device settings menu, you can disable the location
        permissions of specific services to prevent sharing your location information.</p>
    <p>(5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Information you store on Huawei servers. For example,
        the information you upload to the cloud will be stored on Huawei servers for quick access
        and sharing between devices. We will not view the information you store on Huawei servers.
    </p>
    <p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Information from third-party sources</p>
    <p>When permitted by law, Huawei will collect information about you from public and commercial
        sources. Huawei may also obtain certain information from third-party social network
        services, such as the time when you use a social network account to log in to a Huawei
        website.</p>
    <p>Huawei may also collect information about you, your device, or how you use our services
        through other means not detailed here. We will inform or obtain your authorization before
        collecting such information.</p>
    <p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Exceptions to obtaining authorization prior to
        collecting information</p>
    <p>Huawei does not need to obtain your authorized consent prior to collecting and using your
        personal data in scenarios related to:</p>
    <p>(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>National security and defense</p>
    <p>(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Public safety, health, and public interest</p>
    <p>(3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criminal investigations, prosecution, trial, and
        execution of sentences</p>
    <p>(4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The protection of the life, property, and other

    <p>(5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Situations where you have voluntarily made your
        personal data public</p>

        through legal channels, such as news reports, and publicly available information</p>
    <p>(7)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Information necessary to contract signing according
        to your requirements</p>
    <p>(8)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Maintaining the stable operation of the provided
        products and/or services, such as discovering and troubleshooting a product/service</p>

        of non-identifiable data include statistics on website visits, application downloads, and
        product sales volume. Huawei will collect statistics information to understand how users use
        our products and services. By doing so, we can improve our services to better meet your
        requirements. Circumstances may arise where Huawei collects, uses, discloses, and transfers
        non-identifiable data for other purposes at our own discretion.</p>
    <p>B<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How Huawei Uses Your Personal Data</p>

    <p><span id="lable_2"/>2 <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How Huawei Uses Cookies and
        Similar Technologies</p>
    <p>Huawei may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other local storage technologies on its
        websites, mobile apps, online services, emails, and advertisements. The information
        collected through cookies and similar technology is regarded as non-personal data. However,
        if local laws and regulations treat IP addresses and similar identifiers as personal data,
        Huawei will also treat these identifiers as personal data.</p>
    <p>A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cookies</p>
    <p>A cookie is a text file stored by a web server on a computer or mobile device. The content of
        a cookie can only be retrieved and read by the server that created the cookie. Cookies are
        unique to the browser or mobile application you are using. The text in a cookie often
        consists of identifiers, site names, and some numbers and characters.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, Huawei stores cookies on computers or mobile devices for the purpose of improving
        user experience, including the following:</p>
    <p>(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Technical cookies. When you use a Huawei ID to log in
        to a website, the &quot;session-based&quot; cookies ensure that you can navigate from page
        to page, without needing to log in again each time you go to a new page.</p>
    <p>(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Personalization cookies. Storage of your preferences
        and settings. A website can use cookies to save settings, such as the language setting and
        font size on your computer or mobile device, items in your shopping cart, and other browser
        preferences.</p>
    <p>(3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Advertising cookies. Huawei uses cookies to collect
        information about your online activities and interests and provide you with advertisements
        that correlate most highly with you.</p>
    <p>(4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Statistical cookies. With cookies, Huawei can collect
        information about your use of our websites and other applications, either for a single visit
        (using a session cookie) or for repeated visits (using a persistent cookie).</p>
    <p>Huawei will not use cookies for reasons other than the ones detailed in this Statement.</p>
    <p>You can manage or delete cookies at your own preference. For details, visit <a
            href="http://aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">AboutCookies.org</a>. You can clear all
        the cookies stored on your computer, and most current web browsers provide the option of
        blocking cookies. Find out how to manage cookie settings for your browser by going to <a

    <p>If you clear cookies, you will need to change your settings the next time you visit Huawei
        websites. Note that some Huawei services require the use of cookies. Disabling cookies may
        affect your use of some or all functions of these services.</p>
    <p>B<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Web Beacons and Pixel Tags</p>
    <p>In addition to cookies, Huawei and some third parties may also use web beacons and pixel tags
        on websites. A web beacon is usually an electronic graphic image embedded into a website or
        email to identify your device cookies when you browse the website or email. Pixel tags allow
        Huawei to send emails in a format that is readable to you and find out whether an email has
        been opened.</p>
    <p>Huawei and some third parties use these technologies for various purposes, including
        analyzing service usage (along with cookies) and providing more satisfactory content and
        advertisements to you. For example, when you receive an email from Huawei, it may contain a
        click-through URL which links to a Huawei web page. If you click the link, Huawei will track
        your visit to help us learn about your preferences for products and services and improve our
        customer service. You can unsubscribe from Huawei's mailing list at any time if you do not
        want to be tracked in this manner.</p>
    <p>C<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Other Local Storage</p>
    <p>Huawei and some third parties may use other local storage technologies in certain products
        and services, for example, local shared objects (also called &quot;Flash cookies&quot;) and
        HTML5 local storage. Similar to cookies, these technologies store information on your device
        and can record some information about your activities and preferences. However, these
        technologies may use different media from cookies. Therefore, you may not be able to control
        them using standard browser tools and settings. For details about how to disable or delete
        information contained in Flash cookies, click <a
                href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html"
                target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>D<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Do Not Track</p>
    <p>Many web browsers provide a Do Not Track function that can release Do Not Track requests to
        websites. Currently, major Internet standardization organizations have not established
        policies to specify how websites should handle these requests. If you enable Do Not Track in
        your browser, all Huawei websites will respect your selection.</p>
    <p><span id="lable_3"/>3 <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How Huawei Entrusts, Shares,
        Transfers, and Discloses Your Personal Data</p>
    <p>A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Entrusting other parties</p>
    <p>In some situations, Huawei may entrust other companies to process your personal data on
        behalf of Huawei. For example, Huawei may entrust another company for hotline support,
        sending emails, and technical support. These companies may only use your personal data to
        provide services to you on Huawei's behalf.</p>
    <p>Huawei and the entrusted party will sign a strict confidentiality agreement or terms and
        conditions for processing personal data. Huawei will require the entrusted party to comply
        with this Statement, and take the relevant security and privacy measures to deal with
        personal data.</p>
    <p>B<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sharing</p>
    <p>Sharing is defined as a process of sharing personal data with persons who will control that
        personal data, where both parties have independent control over personal data. Except in the
        following situations, Huawei will not share your personal data:</p>
    <p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Huawei has received your express authorization: After
        you have authorized Huawei to share your information, Huawei will share information with a
        designated third party within the scope you have authorized.</p>
    <p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pursuant to relevant legal and regulatory
        requirements: Huawei may share your personal data in accordance with laws and regulations,
        the demands of dispute resolution, or according to the legal requirements of administrative
        and judicial authorities.</p>
    <p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sharing with Huawei's affiliates: Your information may
        be shared with Huawei's affiliate companies. We will only share your information with Huawei
        affiliates for specific, definite, and legitimate purposes. We will only share information
        necessary for providing our services. For example, in order to avoid repeat registration of
        Huawei IDs, we will need to verify the global uniqueness of an account before registering
        it.</p>
    <p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sharing with our business partners: In order to
        provide services to you, Huawei may share your order, account, device, and location
        information with our third-party partners. However, we will only share your personal data
        for legal, appropriate, necessary, specific, and clear purposes. We will only share personal
        data that is necessary for providing these services. Our partners include:</p>
    <p>(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third-party sellers and developers: Some of our
        products and services are provided to you directly by third parties. Huawei will transfer
        relevant information to share with third parties in order to meet the needs you have for
        purchasing goods and services from them. For example, if you purchase products from
        third-party developers in our app market, we must provide necessary information about you to
        the third party to complete the transaction.</p>
    <p>(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Goods or technical service providers: Huawei may
        share your personal data to third parties that support our features and functions, including
        third-party suppliers and third parties that provide infrastructure technology services,
        logistics and distribution services, payment services, data services, etc. For example, we
        may need to share your order number and amount with third-party payment organizations in
        order to make and confirm your payment instructions and complete the transaction.</p>
    <p>In the following scenarios (numbers 3 and 4), Huawei always signs a strict confidentiality
        agreement before sharing personal data with companies, organizations, and individuals. We
        require them to abide by this Statement, and take appropriate confidentiality and security
        measures when handling personal data.</p>
    <p>C<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Transfer</p>
    <p>A transfer is defined as Huawei handing over the right to control personal data to another
        information controller. Huawei will not transfer this right to any company, organization, or
        individual, except in the following situations:</p>
    <p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Huawei has received your express authorization: After
        you have authorized Huawei to transfer your information, Huawei will transfer the
        information to another party.</p>
    <p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mergers, acquisitions, or liquidation: If such
        situations involve the transfer of your personal data, Huawei will request that the company
        or organization holding your personal data continue to abide by this Statement. Otherwise,
        Huawei will request that the company or organization seek out your authorization again.</p>
    <p>D<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Public Disclosure</p>
    <p>Huawei will only disclose your information to the public in the following situations: </p>
    <p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Huawei has received your express authorization.</p>
    <p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are reasonable legal grounds for disclosing your
        information. Huawei may disclose your information to the public if there are applicable
        laws, regulations, or procedural requirements to disclose or if public and governmental
        authorities have requested disclosure.</p>
    <p>E<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Exceptions to obtaining authorization prior to sharing,
        transferring, or publicly disclosing your personal data</p>
    <p>Huawei does not need to obtain your authorized consent prior to sharing, transferring, or
        publicly disclosing your personal data in scenarios related to:</p>
    <p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>National security and defense</p>
    <p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Public safety, health, and public interest</p>
    <p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criminal investigations, prosecution, trial, and
        execution of sentences</p>
    <p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The protection of the life, property, and other
        significant legal rights of yourself or others, for which it may be difficult to obtain
        authorization at the time of action</p>
    <p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Situations where you have voluntarily made your
        personal data public</p>
    <p>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Personal data that you have made public obtained
        through legal channels, such as news reports, and publicly available information</p>
    <p>According to the law, the sharing and transferring of personal data that has been cleared of
        identifying information does not constitute sharing, transferring, or publicly disclosure of
        information, as long as the recipient of data cannot recover identifying information or
        identify the subject to whom the personal data belongs. Huawei does not need to notify you
        or obtain your authorization to store or process this type of data.</p>

    <p>Huawei attaches significant importance to the security of your personal data and has adopted
        standard industry practices to protect your personal data and protect it from unauthorized
        access, disclosure, use, modification, damage, or loss. To this end, Huawei takes the
        following measures:</p>
    <p>1.We take reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that the personal data collected is
        minimal and relevant to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
        processed. We retain your personal data for no longer than what is necessary for the
        purposes stated in this Statement and the privacy notice of specific product or service,
        unless extending the retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
    <p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We use a range of technologies such as cryptographic
        technologies to ensure the confidentiality of data in transmission. We implement trusted
        protection mechanisms to protect data and data storage servers from attacks.</p>
    <p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We deploy access control mechanisms to ensure that
        only authorized personnel can access your personal data. In addition, we control the number
        of authorized personnel and implement hierarchical permission management on them based on
        service requirements and personnel levels. Access to personal data will be logged and
        reviewed by authorized personnel on a regular basis.</p>
    <p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We carefully select business partners and service
        providers and incorporate personal data protection requirements into commercial contracts,
        audits, and appraisal activities.</p>
    <p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We hold security and privacy protection training
        courses, tests, and publicity activities to raise employees' personal data protection
        awareness.</p>
    <p>Huawei is committed to protecting your personal data. Nevertheless, no security measure is
        perfect and no product, service, website, data transfer, computing system, or network
        connection is absolutely secure.</p>
    <p>To cope with possible risks, such as personal data leakage, damage, and loss, Huawei has
        developed several mechanisms and control measures, clearly defined the rating standards of
        security incidents and vulnerabilities and corresponding processing procedures, and
        established a dedicated <a href="http://www.huawei.com/en/psirt" target="_blank">Security
            Advisory and Security Notice</a> page. Huawei has established a dedicated emergency
        response team to implement security planning, loss reduction, analysis, locating, and
        remediation, and to perform tracking operations with related departments based on security
        incident handling regulations and requirements.</p>
    <p>If any personal data incident occurs, Huawei will notify you, pursuant to relevant legal and
        regulatory requirements, of the basic information about the security incident and its
        possible impact, measures that Huawei has taken or will take suggestions about active
        defense and risk mitigation, and remedial measures. The notification may take the form of an
        email, text message, push notification, etc. If it is difficult to notify data subjects one
        by one, we will take appropriate and effective measures to release a Security Notice. In
        addition, we will also report the handling status of personal data security incidents as
        required by supervisory authorities.</p>
    <p><span id="lable_5"/>5 <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How You Can Manage Your Personal
        Data</p>
    <p>A<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Access, rectification, deletion</p>
    <p>Legislation in some countries and regions to which Huawei provides products and services
        provides that data subjects have the right to access, rectify, or delete related personal
        data retained by Huawei. In the aforementioned countries and regions, data subjects or their
        agents may make requests (hereinafter referred to as &quot;requests&quot;) to access,
        rectify, or delete relevant personal data retained by Huawei.</p>
    <p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Requesting methods and channels</p>
    <p>Data subjects' requests must be submitted in writing. The requests are valid even when the
        requester does not specify the laws on which the requests are based. Usually, verbal
        requests are not valid; however, if the legislation of some countries admits verbal
        requests, then Huawei will abide by such legislation.</p>
    <p>Data subjects' requests may be initiated through the <a
            href="http://consumer.huawei.com/en/privacy-questions/" target="_blank">official website
        of Huawei Consumer BG</a>, HiCare app, or Huawei ID app. If a data subject initiates a
        request via a hotline, email, online customer service, service center, or another channel,
        we will instruct the data subject to officially raise the request through one of the
        aforementioned channels to facilitate communication and feedback of progress and results.
        The dedicated request channels for data subjects are intended to protect data subjects'
        lawful interests, ensure Huawei's normal operation, and prevent the right to request from
        being misused or fraudulently used.</p>
    <p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Validity of requests</p>
    <p>Most laws require data subjects to comply with specific requirements when they initiate
        requests. This Statement requires data subjects to:</p>
    <p>(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Submit requests through dedicated request channels
        provided by Huawei (namely, the official website of Huawei Consumer BG, HiCare app, and
        Huawei ID app).</p>
    <p>(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Provide sufficient information for Huawei to verify
        their identities (to ensure those who initiate the requests are the data subjects themselves
        or those authorized by them).</p>
    <p>(3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ensure that their requests are specific and feasible.
    </p>
    <p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Request processing period</p>
    <p>Huawei shall endeavor to respond within a month of receiving a request to access personal
        information. Depending on the number of requests and the complexity of the request, this
        period may be extended to two months if necessary. If the request period is extended, Huawei
        shall notify the data subject of the situation and reason for delay. If the period
        stipulated in this section conflicts with local laws and regulations, local laws and
        regulations shall prevail. </p>
    <p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Request results</p>
    <p>After the request is submitted, the following may occur:</p>
    <p>(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Request may be declined</p>
    <p>Requests from data subjects may be declined in the following situations, including but not
        limited to:</p>
    <p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Local law does not grant these rights to the personal
        data subject</p>
    <p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The identity of the requester cannot be verified</p>
    <p>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The request cannot be verified, or exceeds the scope,
        especially in situations when repeat requests are sent</p>
    <p>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the information is related to compensation that
        Huawei will make or receive as a result of an ongoing dispute, and the disclosure of such
        information may damage Huawei's interests</p>
    <p>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the retained information is being used for
        statistical and research purposes only, and if the statistical and research findings will
        not reveal personal identity</p>
    <p>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Other legal provisions</p>
    <p>If Huawei declines a request from a data subject, we will give the requester a formal
        explanation for declining.</p>
    <p>(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Request may be successful</p>
    <p>If the scenarios listed in the previous section (1) do not occur, Huawei will meet the
        request of the data subject. In order to improve the likelihood of your request succeeding,
        please provide as much detailed information as possible when submitting your request.
        Details to provide can include request type, specific information, information about the
        data subject (such as the account name you use for Huawei products and services), and the
        time frame in which the information was generated or processed. Requests within a shorter
        period of time have a higher likelihood of success.</p>
    <p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Special note</p>
    <p>(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Only legal guardians or legally authorized persons
        have the right to access the personal information of others.</p>
    <p>(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Most legal provisions clarify situations when
        organizations are not required to provide information to data subjects. Situations include
        scenarios when providing data may undermine ongoing efforts against terrorism, when the data
        subject has made repeated requests, when obtaining and providing such information shall
        consume disproportionate resources.</p>
    <p>(3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In principle, Huawei will not provide the following
        types of information:</p>
    <p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Information about others: Requests from data subjects
        may involve other individuals besides the data subject. Unless authorized by the relevant
        individuals, Huawei shall not provide such information.</p>
    <p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Repeat requests: If the data subject makes multiple
        requests of the same type related to the same data subject, and the data has not changed
        since the last time Huawei provided the data. In this case, Huawei will not usually provide
        a copy of the data. Additionally, Huawei does not have a responsibility to provide to
        individuals data that has already been made public.</p>
    <p>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Confidential opinions: If the requested information
        related to the data subject is a confidential opinion, Huawei does not have a responsibility
        to provide such information.</p>
    <p>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Special documents: Huawei will not disclose any
        special information in response to requests for accessing personal information. Typically,
        special information includes any confidential documents such as attorney/client
        communication, or information that obtains or expresses a corresponding legal opinion,
        whether it is related to the lawsuit itself or related to information from court
        proceedings.</p>
    <p>B<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Withdrawal of Authorization </p>
    <p>You can withdraw or modify your authorization to us to continue collecting your personal
        information by deleting data, disabling device features, and modifying the privacy settings
        on your Huawei device or app. You can withdraw your authorization to allow Huawei to collect
        your personal information during operations related to your Huawei account by canceling your
        account.</p>
    <p>Please note that all operations and functions require some basic personal data to function.
        When you withdraw your authorization, we will be unable to continue providing the service
        for which you have withdrawn your authorization, and we will also cease processing your
        relevant personal data. However, if you withdraw your consent or authorization, it will not
        be effective against how the personal data collected about you during the period of
        authorization is processed.</p>
    <p>How to withdraw your consent or authorization for a specific product or service is detailed
        in the Privacy Statement and supplementary statement attached to that product or
        service.</p>
    <p>C<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Deregistering a Huawei ID</p>
    <p>You can deregister your account in Huawei ID-enabled products. After you deregister your
        account, we will stop providing products and services, and delete your personal data unless
        otherwise stipulated by law. Your account cannot be restored after deregistration. You need
        to register a new Huawei ID if you want to use related Huawei products or services again.
        You can submit a deregistration application and complete the process in the following
        ways:</p>
    <p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Phone or tablet</p>

    <p><span id="lable_6"/>6 <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How Huawei Protects Children's
        Personal Data</p>
    <p>Huawei's personal and home products are intended for adults. However, in relation to the use
        of Huawei products and services by children, we are fully aware of the importance of taking
        extra preventive measures to protect privacy and security. Huawei defines data subjects as
        children if they have not reached the age of 18 or if they have not reached the age of
        majority defined by laws of the local countries and regions.</p>
    <p>When children's personal data is collected based on the authorization of the holders of
        parental responsibility, we will only use or disclose the information as permitted by law,
        explicitly authorized by the holders of parental responsibility, or required for protecting
        the children. Holders of parental responsibility, who need to access, modify, or delete the
        personal data of their children and people under guardianship can contact us via the
        channels provided in &quot;How Huawei Protects Your Personal Data&quot;.</p>
    <p>If Huawei accidentally collects children's personal data without obtaining authorization from
        provable holders of parental responsibility, Huawei will delete the information as soon as
        possible once it is aware of the issue.</p>
    <p><span id="lable_7"/>7 <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Links to Third-Party Websites,
        Products, and Services</p>
    <p>Huawei websites, application software, products, and services may contain links to
        third-party websites, products, and services. Huawei products and services may also use or
        provide products or services from third parties, for example, third-party apps released on
        Huawei app store HiApp.</p>
    <p>All links to third-party websites, products, and services are provided for users' convenience
        only. Huawei has no control over such third parties and cannot provide express or implied
        warranties regarding the content of the links. Such links are not regarded as Huawei's
        recommendation or authorization of the linked content. Huawei also has no control over the
        privacy or data protection policies of third parties and such third parties are not bound by
        this statement.</p>
    <p>You need to determine your interaction with such links on your own. Before submitting your
        personal data to third parties, please read and refer to these third parties' privacy
        policies.</p>
    <p><span id="lable_8"/>8 <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>International Transfers of Your
        Personal Data</p>
    <p>Our products and services are delivered through resources and servers located all over the
        world. This means that your personal information may be transferred to or accessed by other
        jurisdictions outside of the country in which you use the products or services. Such
        jurisdictions may have less stringent data protection laws or may not even have data
        protection laws in place. In these cases, Huawei will ensure that your data is fully and
        equally protected by all applicable laws and regulations. For example, Huawei will ask for
        your authorization to cross-border transfers of personal information or implement security
        measures such as data anonymity before the transfers. For users in mainland China, your
        personal information will be stored on the server in mainland China.</p>
