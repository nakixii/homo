    These are the default set of preferred applications for various standard
    web URIs of Google properties to built-in Google Android applications.

    To generate new entries, set whatever app you want to be the default as
    normal through the UI, and then use "adb shell dumpsys package preferred-xml"
    to get the XML structure for the current preferred apps.  You will probably
    want to clean up the output some, such as adding the BROWSABLE category.  See
    the other entries here for guides.
